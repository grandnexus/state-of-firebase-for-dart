# A list of all libraries that (try to) cover Firebase for Dart

### *Why?*
Dart is lacking an official implementation of a firebase sdk in native Dart code.

The existing wrappers around official SDKs are on the *FirebaseExtended* org on Github , which means 
"Projects that are not officially staffed by Googlers [...]".


### *The current state*
There are ...
- (kind of) official wrappers around JS, iOS or Android SDKs, with varying syntax on the different target platforms or even lacking support of many Firebase features on some targets (especially Dart VM)
- unofficial attempts to create unified wrappers for all target platforms
- unofficial and incomplete attempts to create a Dart native package for Firebase
